=head1 NAME

File::ManualFlock::FlockOverride - 
    overrides flock, if implemented on system, or provides manual file locking
    for systems without standard flock function (Win95/98/??); uses File::ManualFlock
    to lock files; overrides flock, open, and close functions in the calling package
    
=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    use File::ManualFlock::FlockOverride qw( :flock_override );
    
    open( $fh, ">$filepath" );
    my $lock = (LOCK_SH|LOCK_NB);
    my $fl_result = flock( $fh, $lock );
    close( $fh );
    
    See File::ManualFlock docs or flock() docs for more details regarding the possible 
    values for $lock.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows the File::ManualLock module to be used as a substitute for flock.

Mflock, like flock, is an advisory locking mechanism.  Mflock can be
used as a substitute for flock, but it will not detect files locked
with flock.  Likewise, flock will not detect files locked with mflock.  
Thus, while File::ManualFlock::FlockOverride offers a 'flock'
function that when used will override the standard flock and provide
the same interface, the two locking methods cannot be used
interchangeably. You must choose one or the other and go with it.

=head1 NOTES

Even though the flock function provided by this module is simply a wrapper
around mflock method provided by the File::ManualLock module,
its default behavior is different in order to match up with the standard 
flock function's behavior (on systems where it is implemented.)  Thus, the 
flock function provided here will not clobber expired locks and is blocking
by default.

This behavior is given by the line in the function File::ManualLock::FlockOverride::flock
that calls the File::ManualLock::mflock method as follows:

  $lh_keep_alive{$fh} = $mf->mflock( $filepath, $lock, MFL_INFINITE, MFL_INFINITE );

You can modify the $max_wait and $expire params in the code in order to achieve
another desired default behavior.  See the File::ManualFlock docs for additional
details on the mflock method that it provides.

=head1 LICENSE

Same as Perl.

=head1 CREDIT

Much of the techniques and code in this module that allows these functions
to override the core functions is borrowed from William Herrera's File::FlockDir
module.  However, the underlying flock code was written from scratch.
